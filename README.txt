This repository contains the source code for a project I did for my Network Security and Forensics class. This was a semester-long project that required students to detect amplification attacks in a given darkset dataset. The main C++ file reads in from a large .pcap file and determines the ips that are suspicious. Afterward, these ips can be viewed on a map. This respository does not contain the .pcap dataset or its dependencies such as the libtins library.
